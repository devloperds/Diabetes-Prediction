# Diabetes-Prediction
Prediction of Diabetes using Supervised Learning--Python

🌟 Project Overview
A powerful machine learning system that predicts diabetes risk with 77.1% accuracy by analyzing key health biomarkers. This end-to-end solution transforms raw medical data into actionable insights through:
Intelligent data imputation
Comprehensive feature analysis
Multiple ML model benchmarking
Neural network implementation

Real-world impact: Early diabetes detection can reduce complication risks by up to 50% (ADA)

🔍 Key Insights from EDA
Our exploratory analysis revealed:
1.Critical Predictors:
Glucose levels (ρ = 0.47)
BMI (ρ = 0.29)
Age (ρ = 0.24)

2.Data Challenges:
35 missing BloodPressure values
227 missing SkinThickness values
374 missing Insulin values

3.Notable Patterns:
Patients with BMI > 30 had 3.5x higher diabetes incidence
Glucose levels < 100 mg/dL rarely resulted in positive diagnoses
